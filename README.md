## 1. What It Does

The platform automates the full B2B sales prospecting cycle for utility cost-reduction consultants:

```
Find companies  →  Enrich contacts  →  Score as leads
→  Draft personalized emails  →  Human review  →  Send
→  Schedule follow-ups  →  Track replies
```

**Two human checkpoints — nothing moves forward without approval:**
1. After scoring: approve or skip each lead before any email is written
2. After drafting: approve, edit, or reject each email before it is sent

**What is fully automated (no human needed):**
- Daily news scan for companies with high utility spend signals
- Contact lookup and enrichment (8-step waterfall)
- Scoring 0–100 with LLM narrative explanation
- Email drafting with AI Critic review loop (up to 2 rewrites)
- Sending via SendGrid with open/click tracking
- Follow-up scheduling (Day 3 / 7 / 14)

### Docker Services

```
docker-compose up
  ├── api       (port 8001)  FastAPI backend — all agents run inside this process
  └── frontend  (port 3000)  nginx serving the Vite-built React app
```

No separate agent containers. Airflow is a scheduled add-on (not required to run the platform).
Database is external PostgreSQL — not in Docker.

## 3. Agent System

### Agentic Design Principle

```
Old (rule-based):  fixed query → fixed formula → fixed output

Agentic (current): LLM reasons about available data
                       → decides what tools to call and in what order
                       → executes tools (APIs, DB, scoring math)
                       → evaluates result quality
                       → loops if not good enough
                       → returns result
```

**LLM = decision and reasoning layer only.**
**APIs / DB / math = deterministic tools it calls.**
LLM never does math directly. LLM classifies, infers, decides, evaluates, generates text.

---

### Scout Agent — Company Discovery

Reads business news daily via Tavily and extracts companies with intent signals — new facilities opening, expansions, multi-location operations — that indicate high utility spend.

```
Tavily news search (industry + location queries)
  ↓
LLM extracts: company name, industry, city, why it's a signal
  ↓
Deduplication against existing companies in DB
  ↓
Save new companies with source = 'news_scout'
```

Sources used:
```
1. Tavily news mode   — AI-powered news search for intent signals
2. Google Maps        — Places API for local business discovery
3. Yelp               — Business Search API
4. Directory Scraper  — configured sources (Yellow Pages, local directories)
```

---

### Analyst Agent — Enrichment + Scoring

For each new company, the Analyst finds the right contact and computes a fit score.

```
Load company from DB
  ↓
Contact enrichment waterfall (8 steps):
  Hunter.io → Apollo → website scraper → Serper →
  Snov.io → Prospeo → ZeroBounce → permutation fallback
  ↓
Phone enrichment: Google Places → Yelp → website scraper
  ↓
LLM Data Inspector:
  Infers missing industry from company name
  Detects data gaps → triggers re-enrichment if needed
  ↓
score_engine.compute_score(...)   ← deterministic math
  Score = (Recovery × 0.40) + (Industry × 0.25) + (Multisite × 0.20) + (Data × 0.15)
  ↓
LLM Score Narrator:
  Generates a plain-English explanation of why this company scores this way
```

Tier: **≥70 = high**, **40–69 = medium**, **<40 = low**

---

### Writer Agent — Draft Generation + Critic Loop

```
Writer:
  Reads email_win_rate for the best-performing angle in this industry
  Reads company data + score narrative
  Generates full email: subject line + body (personalized, with savings figure, clear CTA)
  ↓
Critic (second LLM call):
  Scores draft 0–10 on: personalization, savings figure, CTA clarity, human tone, subject line
  Returns score + specific improvement instructions
  ↓
If score < 7: Writer rewrites using Critic feedback (max 2 rewrites)
If score ≥ 7: save draft → Email Review queue
If still < 7 after 2 rewrites: save with low_confidence=true → flagged in UI
```

The email angle used (e.g. `"audit_offer"`) is saved as `template_used`.
When a reply is received, Tracker updates `email_win_rate` → future Writer runs bias toward winning angles per industry.

---

### Run Tracking

Every pipeline trigger creates one `agent_runs` row:

```
agent_runs
  id, trigger_source ("dashboard" / "airflow"), status, current_stage
  companies_found, companies_scored, drafts_created, emails_sent
  started_at, completed_at, error_message
```

Every tool call appends one `agent_run_logs` row — full audit trail.

### Planned: Vector Memory (Knowledge Base)

The next major agentic upgrade gives the Writer agent **long-term memory** about Troy & Banks
services, case studies, and proof points — retrieved semantically per company before writing.

```
Company profile: "manufacturing, 12 sites, Ohio, overpaying on gas"
        ↓
Retrieval Agent (nomic-embed-text → pgvector cosine search)
        ↓
Top 3 relevant items:
  • Case study: Ohio manufacturer, 8 sites, cut gas by $80k → [link]
  • Service: multi-site utility contract renegotiation
  • CTA: Free 30-min audit → calendly.com/kevingibs/30min
        ↓
Writer weaves them naturally into the email
```

**Why pgvector, not a separate vector DB:**
`nomic-embed-text` already runs in Ollama. pgvector runs inside existing PostgreSQL.
No new container, no new service, no separate backup process.

**Why not a knowledge graph (Neo4j etc.):**
Vector similarity handles the main use case (find relevant case studies for this company type).
Graph reasoning is only needed for multi-hop queries like "which service performs best in
deregulated manufacturing states" — add that later if needed.

See `docs/AGENTIC_TRANSFORMATION_PLAN.md` Phases KB-0 through KB-4 for full build plan.

## 5. Project Status

### What Works End-to-End Right Now

You can run this full sequence today with no missing pieces:

```
1. Triggers page → Run Scout
   → Companies discovered from business news and saved to DB

2. Triggers page → Run Analyst
   → Contacts found, companies scored 0–100 with narrative explanation

3. Leads page → review scores → Approve high-tier leads

4. Triggers page → Run Writer
   → Personalized emails drafted, AI Critic review loop runs

5. Email Review page → read each draft → Approve & Send
   → Email sent via SendGrid, follow-ups scheduled in DB

Pipeline stages update automatically at every step.
```

## 8. Dashboard Pages

| Page | Route | What it shows |
|---|---|---|
| **Leads** | `/leads` | All companies with search + filters — approve/reject leads |
| **Email Review** | `/emails` | Pending email drafts — approve / edit+approve / reject |
| **Triggers** | `/triggers` | Manual pipeline controls: Scout, Analyst, Enrich, Writer |

---

## 9. Observability & Monitoring

### Option 1 — Docker Logs (always available)

```bash
docker-compose logs api -f
```

Shows HTTP requests, agent steps, and errors in real time.

### Option 2 — LangSmith (recommended — visual trace per run)

LangSmith shows every LLM call, which tool was chosen, arguments, token counts, and latency in a visual timeline.

**Setup:**
1. Sign up free at https://smith.langchain.com
2. Go to Settings → API Keys → Create API Key
3. Add to `.env`:

```env
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=ls__your_key_here
LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=utility-lead-platform
```

4. Rebuild and restart the API container.

### Option 3 — Database Query (audit trail)

Every agent step is persisted in PostgreSQL:

```sql
-- Last 10 agent runs with status
SELECT id, trigger_source, status, current_stage,
       companies_found, error_message, created_at
FROM agent_runs
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Every step in a specific run
SELECT agent, action, status, output_summary, duration_ms
FROM agent_run_logs
WHERE run_id = '<run-id>'
ORDER BY logged_at ASC;
```

Or via API: `GET http://localhost:8001/pipeline/run/{run_id}`

---

## 10. Database Tables

All tables live in external PostgreSQL. Migrations are in `database/migrations/`.

## 12. Troubleshooting

### API not responding
```bash
docker-compose logs api --tail 30
docker-compose restart api
```

### Ollama not responding (LLM calls fail)
```bash
ollama serve          # start Ollama if not running
ollama list           # confirm llama3.2 is pulled
curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags
```
Inside Docker, Ollama is reached via `host.docker.internal:11434`.
Confirm `OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:11434` in `.env`.

### Scout finds 0 companies
- Check `TAVILY_API_KEY` is set and quota is not exceeded
- Check API logs: `docker-compose logs api -f`

### Database connection error
- Confirm `DATABASE_URL` is correct in `.env`
- Test: `docker exec <api-container> python -c "from database.connection import engine; print(engine.url)"`

### Frontend blank page / 404 on refresh
Rebuild the frontend container:
```bash
docker-compose build frontend && docker-compose up -d frontend
```

### SendGrid emails not delivering
- Verify sender email is authenticated in SendGrid dashboard
- Confirm `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL` matches the verified sender identity
- Check SendGrid activity feed for blocked or rejected messages

### Code changes not showing
Always rebuild the relevant container after editing code:
```bash
docker-compose build api && docker-compose up -d api      # after backend changes
docker-compose build frontend && docker-compose up -d frontend  # after UI changes
```
