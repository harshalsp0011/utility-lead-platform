# Utility Lead Intelligence Platform

## 1. Project Overview

Utility Lead Intelligence Platform is an AI-assisted prospecting and outreach system for the Troy & Banks sales team. It finds target companies, scores them for fit and savings potential, generates personalized outbound emails, sends approved sequences, and monitors replies so sales can focus on the highest-intent opportunities. The platform works through five AI agents operating together in a staged pipeline: Scout discovers companies, Analyst scores and enriches them, Writer drafts outreach, Outreach manages delivery and follow-ups, and Tracker captures engagement signals and alerts the team when a prospect responds.

## 2. Architecture Overview

![Architecture Design Reference](./Design.png)

The platform is organized into six layers:

1. Data Sources
	Public directories, company websites, benchmark datasets, enrichment providers, and email/webhook providers.
2. Agent Engine
	The five operational agents plus orchestration logic that move leads through the pipeline.
3. Data Store
	PostgreSQL tables for companies, features, scores, contacts, drafts, and outreach events.
4. API Layer
	FastAPI routes that expose leads, emails, reports, pipeline health, and trigger controls.
5. Dashboard
	React frontend for operators to review leads, approve emails, launch runs, and inspect status.
6. Alerts
	Slack and email notifications for hot replies, failures, and operational visibility.

### Agent Responsibilities

| Agent | Single Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Scout | Finds target companies from public sources and websites. |
| Analyst | Scores leads, estimates savings, and enriches contact data. |
| Writer | Generates personalized outbound emails for approved leads. |
| Outreach | Sends emails and manages follow-up sequences. |
| Tracker | Monitors engagement, classifies replies, and alerts the sales team. |

### Layer Flow

`Data Sources -> Agent Engine -> Data Store -> API Layer -> Dashboard -> Alerts`

## 7. Phase 1 to Phase 2 Upgrade

The platform is designed so the Phase 1 to Phase 2 transition is primarily a configuration change, not a code rewrite.

### What Changes

| Capability | Phase 1 | Phase 2 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LLM | Ollama | OpenAI GPT-4o mini |
| Database | Local PostgreSQL | AWS RDS PostgreSQL |
| Search | Tavily free tier | Serper paid |
| Proxies | ScraperAPI free/trial | Bright Data |
| Contacts | Hunter.io free tier | Apollo.io paid |
| Email | SendGrid free tier | Instantly.ai |

### How to Upgrade

1. Open `.env`.
2. Change provider selectors such as `LLM_PROVIDER`, `SEARCH_PROVIDER`, `PROXY_PROVIDER`, `ENRICHMENT_PROVIDER`, and `EMAIL_PROVIDER`.
3. Replace local/free-tier credentials with paid production credentials.
4. Update `DATABASE_URL` to point at AWS RDS.
5. Restart the stack.

```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up --build -d
```

No code changes are required if your provider values and credentials are set correctly.

## 8. Deployment to AWS

1. Launch a `t3.medium` EC2 instance running Ubuntu 22.04.
2. SSH into the instance.

	```bash
	ssh -i /path/to/key.pem ubuntu@<ec2-public-ip>
	```

3. Install Docker and Docker Compose on EC2.

	```bash
	sudo apt update
	sudo apt install -y docker.io docker-compose-plugin git
	sudo systemctl enable --now docker
	sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
	```

4. Clone the repository to EC2.

	```bash
	git clone <your-repo-url>
	cd utility-lead-platform
	```

5. Copy your `.env` file to EC2 and replace Phase 1 values with Phase 2 credentials.

6. Run the platform in detached mode.

	```bash
	docker-compose up --build -d
	```

7. Configure the EC2 security group to open ports `80`, `443`, `3000`, and `8001`.
8. Point your domain DNS `A` record to the EC2 public IP.
9. Install an SSL certificate with Let's Encrypt.
10. Access the dashboard using your domain.

Typical production hardening after first deploy:

- Put Nginx or another reverse proxy in front of the frontend and API.
- Restrict direct access to internal-only ports where possible.
- Move PostgreSQL to AWS RDS instead of exposing the containerized local database externally.
- Store `.env` securely and rotate external credentials.

## 9. Agent Reference

### Scout

- Output: `company_features`, `lead_scores`, and optionally enriched contacts.
- Key scripts: `agents/analyst/analyst_agent.py`, `agents/analyst/benchmarks_loader.py`, `agents/analyst/spend_calculator.py`, `agents/analyst/savings_calculator.py`, `agents/analyst/score_engine.py`, `agents/analyst/enrichment_client.py`.
- Manual test run:

  ```bash
  python3 -c "from database.connection import get_db; from agents.analyst import analyst_agent; db = get_db(); print(analyst_agent.run(['<company-id>'], db))"
  ```

### Writer

- Purpose: Generates personalized email drafts for approved, scored leads.
- Input: Company, feature, score, contact, and sender context.
- Output: Email drafts stored in `email_drafts`.
- Key scripts: `agents/writer/writer_agent.py`, `agents/writer/template_engine.py`, `agents/writer/llm_connector.py`, `agents/writer/tone_validator.py`.
- Manual test run:

  ```bash
  python3 -c "from database.connection import get_db; from agents.writer import writer_agent; db = get_db(); print(writer_agent.process_one_company('<company-id>', db))"
  ```

### Outreach

- Purpose: Sends approved emails and manages the follow-up queue.
- Input: Approved drafts, contact records, provider credentials, daily send limits.
- Output: Sent email activity in `outreach_events` and scheduled follow-up records.
- Key scripts: `agents/outreach/outreach_agent.py`, `agents/outreach/email_sender.py`, `agents/outreach/followup_scheduler.py`, `agents/outreach/sequence_manager.py`.
- Manual test run:

  ```bash

  ```

### Tracker

- Key scripts: `agents/tracker/tracker_agent.py`, `agents/tracker/webhook_listener.py`, `agents/tracker/reply_classifier.py`, `agents/tracker/status_updater.py`, `agents/tracker/alert_sender.py`.
- Manual test run:

  ```bash
  python3 -c "from database.connection import get_db; from agents.tracker import tracker_agent; db = get_db(); print(tracker_agent.run_daily_checks(db))"
  ```

## 10. Troubleshooting

### Ollama not responding

Fix:

```bash
ollama serve
```

Also verify:

```bash
curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags
```

### PostgreSQL connection refused

Fix: make sure Docker Compose is running and the PostgreSQL container is healthy.

```bash
docker ps
docker-compose up -d postgres
```

### Tavily returning no results

Fix:

- Check `TAVILY_API_KEY` in `.env`.
- Confirm the free-tier limit has not been exceeded.
- Restart the affected service after changing credentials.

### SendGrid emails not delivering

Fix:

- Verify the sender email in SendGrid.
- Confirm `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL` matches the verified sender identity.
- Check the SendGrid activity feed for rejected or blocked messages.

### Airflow DAG not appearing

Fix:

```bash
docker-compose restart airflow
docker logs <airflow-container-name>
```

Also verify that the `dags/` folder contains the expected DAG files. This project mounts the DAG and project folders directly into the Airflow container.

### Dashboard blank page

Fix:

- Confirm the frontend container is running.
- Confirm the API container is running.
- Check that the dashboard is pointing to the correct API host.

```bash
docker ps
```

If you use a custom frontend environment, verify `REACT_APP_API_URL` points to the correct host.

### Agents producing no leads

Fix:

- Check `directory_sources` table for active sources.
- Run Scout manually from the Triggers page or via a direct Python command.
- Check Airflow and container logs for errors from Scout or Analyst.

Useful commands:

```bash
docker logs <scout-container-name>
docker logs <api-container-name>
docker logs <airflow-container-name>
```
