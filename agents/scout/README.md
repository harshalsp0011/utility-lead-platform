# Scout Agent Files

This folder holds the code that finds company data from public directories.

`scout_agent.py`
Main coordinator for the Scout workflow. It chooses sources, runs scraping,
validates candidates, enriches data from company websites, and saves records.

`directory_scraper.py`
Loads active sources from DB, downloads directory pages, follows pagination, and returns raw company listing cards.

`company_extractor.py`
Takes those raw listing cards, cleans the fields, normalizes values like state and phone, checks duplicates, and saves companies to the database.

`website_crawler.py`
Visits each company website (including JavaScript-rendered pages via Playwright) and extracts enrichment signals such as location count, employee signals, and facility type.

`search_client.py`
Calls the configured search provider (currently Tavily) to discover extra directory/member-list URLs when configured DB sources are exhausted.

How they work together:

1. `scout_agent.py` starts the run with target industry, location, and count.
2. It loads sources from the `directory_sources` database table.
3. It calls `directory_scraper.py` to fetch listing pages.
4. It sends each listing into `company_extractor.py` for cleanup and normalization.
5. It uses `website_crawler.py` for website-based enrichment signals.
6. It saves cleaned and enriched records into the database tables.

Operational note:
- If one configured source fails to load or parse, `scout_agent.py` now logs the failure and continues to the next eligible source instead of aborting the whole scout run.
- If a listing does not include an explicit category/industry value, `scout_agent.py` falls back to the source-level `category` from `directory_sources` before deciding whether to discard the record as `unknown`.
- Duplicate protection now compares normalized full website URLs (exact URL match) instead of broad domain matching.
- `directory_scraper.py` now auto-loads proxy settings from `.env` when no explicit proxy is passed. With `PROXY_PROVIDER=scraperapi` (or `brightdata`), outbound directory fetches run through that proxy automatically.

Source matching note:
- `POST /trigger/scout` loads sources from the `directory_sources` database table.
- If no eligible configured source remains, `scout_agent.py` now falls back to dynamic source discovery via `search_client.py` when `SEARCH_PROVIDER=tavily` and `TAVILY_API_KEY` is set.
- Tavily-discovered sources are persisted into `directory_sources` so future runs can reuse them without calling Tavily for the same URLs.
- The request `industry` is matched against each source entry's `category`.
- The request `location` is matched against each source entry's `location`.
- `count` only controls how many companies scout tries to save; it does not affect which URLs are chosen.
- `run_mode` chooses the pipeline mode; it does not affect source selection.

Scraping proxy setup:
- `PROXY_PROVIDER=scraperapi` requires `SCRAPERAPI_KEY`.
- `PROXY_PROVIDER=brightdata` requires `BRIGHTDATA_KEY`.
- `PROXY_PROVIDER=none` disables proxy usage.
- Invalid proxy configuration no longer crashes scout; scraper logs a warning and falls back to direct requests.

This means the scraper collects raw directory data, the extractor normalizes it,
and the crawler adds website intelligence before persistence.
