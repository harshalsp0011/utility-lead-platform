## Feature Status

### What Works End-to-End Right Now

```
1. Triggers page → Run Scout
   → LLM plans 3–5 query variants → searches Google Maps + Yelp + Tavily
   → LLM deduplicates → saves companies to DB

2. Triggers page → Run Analyst
   → LLM infers industry + detects data gaps
   → 8-source contact enrichment waterfall
   → Spend + savings calculated → scored 0–100
   → Notification email sent to ALERT_EMAIL with lead list

3. Leads page → review scores → Approve high-tier leads

4. Triggers page → Run Writer
   → LLM picks angle (win-rate biased if ≥5 samples)
   → Draft generated → Critic scores → rewrite if <7 (max 2)
   → low_confidence flag set if never reaches 7
   → Notification email sent with draft list

5. Email Review page → read each draft → Approve & Send
   → Email sent via SendGrid → follow-ups scheduled (Day 3/7/14)

6. Outreach scheduler → sends follow-ups as they come due
   → Sequence complete after Day 14 → company.status = no_response
```

## What Is Built But Not Fully Wired

| Feature | What Exists | What's Missing |
|---|---|---|
| Tracker `process_event()` routing | Webhook receives and parses events; `status_updater`, `reply_classifier`, `alert_sender` all built | Full routing inside `process_event()` — each event type not yet dispatched to the right handler |
| Win-rate feedback loop | `email_win_rate` table, Writer reads it, Tracker handlers written | Tracker doesn't write to `email_win_rate` yet (needs `process_event` wiring) |
| Airflow scheduling | DAGs exist | Airflow not running as a live scheduled service — follow-ups and daily checks must be triggered manually |

---

## What Is Not Built

### Reply Detection via CRM
After send, the platform has no way to receive replies coming through a CRM (e.g., deal stage change, meeting booked via CRM calendar).

**To build:**
- `POST /api/webhooks/crm/reply` — CRM fires on inbound reply → match contact → log reply event → cancel follow-ups → set status=replied → alert sales
- `POST /api/webhooks/crm/meeting` — CRM fires on meeting booked → set status=meeting_booked → cancel follow-ups

### CRM Push Sync
After email is sent, company/contact/deal not pushed to CRM. Sales team has no CRM view.

**To build:**
- After `send_email()` succeeds → create Contact + Deal in CRM via CRM REST API
- On status change (replied → meeting_booked → won) → update CRM deal stage
- Platform is CRM-agnostic — same pattern for any CRM with REST API + webhooks

### CRM Import
No way to pull existing contacts from a CRM into the platform.

**To build:**
- "Import from CRM" on Leads page → fetch contacts from CRM Contacts API → map to companies/contacts tables → enter scoring pipeline

### Manual Lead Add
No form to add a company manually.

**To build:**
- Form: company name, website, industry, state, contact name, email, title
- Creates company + contact rows with `source="manual"`

### Dashboard — Reply Inbox
No page to view and manage received replies.

**To build:** `src/pages/Replies.jsx` — list replies with company, contact, reply text, sentiment, date, link to company detail

### Dashboard — Company Timeline
No full history view per company.

**To build:** Timeline on Lead Detail page — discovered → scored → approved → emailed → opened → replied → meeting booked

### Dashboard — Notification Center
No in-app alerts for replies, failures, or approvals needed.

**To build:** `src/components/NotificationCenter.jsx` — badge count on nav, click navigates to relevant page

## What Is Deferred

| Feature | Reason |
|---|---|
| Bulk approve all emails in Email Review | Low priority — individual approval preferred for quality control |
| Phase D: Chat dynamic filter combinations | Chat already handles most cases via 3-tier routing |
| SerpAPI as Scout news source | Enhancement — Scout works well with current sources |

---

## Build Priority

```
1. Tracker process_event() full wiring     ← closes the reply detection gap cheaply (code exists)
   → connects webhook → classifier → status_updater → alert_sender

2. Win-rate writeback                      ← activates learning loop (needs #1 first)
   → Tracker writes email_win_rate on reply events

3. Reply detection — CRM webhook           ← closes biggest pipeline gap
   POST /api/webhooks/crm/reply + /meeting

4. CRM push sync                           ← gives sales team CRM visibility
   → create deal after send, update on status change

5. Manual lead add + CRM import            ← unlocks existing contacts as source

6. Airflow live scheduling                 ← makes follow-ups and daily checks automatic

7. Reply inbox page                        ← makes replies visible in dashboard

8. Notification center                     ← ties all alerts together in-app

9. Company timeline                        ← full audit trail per company
```
